## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 69
print("Number of friends:", friends)
//:  Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
friends = 50
print("We cannot upate the value because they are constants")
